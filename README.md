### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Samuel Oliveira Alves de Freitas. I am a 25-year-old Brazilian data scientist looking for an entry-level job. I earned a bachelor's degree in Accounting in 2021 but decided to use my analytical skills to build data solutions. 

The main objective of this data science personal project portfolio is to demonstrate my skills in solving business challenges through my knowledge and tools of Data Science, please check out my [Data Science Portfolio](https://samueloliveirads.github.io/portfolio_projetos/). 

I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as ranking customers, regression for sales forecasting.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.

### Data Science Projects:

#### [Classification applied to First booking prediction for new Airbnb users (in progress)](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/airbnb_classifier)

Ranking new users for their first reservation given a number of available countries, using techniques for multi-class and unbalancing.

#### [Clustering Applied to Customer Segmentation in e-commerce](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/Insiders-Loyalty-Program)

Project focused on creating a loyalty program with the most valuable customers of a UK ecommerce company. finding the most valuable customers for the company, who will be eligible for the Insiders loyalty program, as well as providing a detailed profile description of these customers.

#### [Rank-to-learn for Cross-sell in Health Insurance](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/Health_Insurance_Cross_Sell) 

Machine Learning with Rank-to-learn to detect the best customers to cross-sell insurance.
In this project I develop an Machine Learning Model that classifies customers to those most likely to purchase car insurance for a company that already has Health insurance sales. The implementation of the project can deliver a financial gain from 10.34M to 27.54M, an increase of 2.66x from the value.

#### [Time Series Regression Applied to Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/rossman_project)

Machine Learning with regression and time series for sales forecasting.
In this project I developed an algorithm that predicts the sales of a company for the next 6 weeks with a maximum error of 9%. I also found a possible insight that could increase the annual revenue by at least 8%.

### Data Anaysis - Insight Projets

#### [Analysis and strategies for buying and selling in the variable income market](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/backtesting_strategies_for_equities)

 Analysis of the oil and gas market, its volatility, yields and impacts of financial indicators and application of buy and sell strategies for portfolio composition. Time Series models were also applied to forecast the daily stock volatility with an average error of 1.4%.

#### [Insights for buying and selling House](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/project_insight_house_rocket)

Project with the objective of analyzing real estate prices and finding potential purchase and sale prices through data analysis and Insights exposure.
The proposed strategy enables an increase of approximately 28% in revenue.

### Data Engineering - ETL Projets

#### [Web Scraping and ETL applied to Jeans Retail Insights (in progress)](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/webscraping_jeans)

In this project I collect data from a Jeans company's website using web scraping and save it to a local database to generate insights about the market.

### Competitions

#### [Classification applied for credit card limit increase](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/Hackday_3_edicao_Comunidade_DS)

In this competition, which lasted an average of one and a half days, the team, composed of four members, developed a credit card limit increase evaluation model for Billion Bank.

#### [Regression applied to forecast the sales values of used cars](https://github.com/SamuelOliveirads/Hackday_2_edicao_Comunidade-DS)

In this competition, which lasted an average of one and a half days, the team, composed of five members, developed a project to forecast the value of used cars with the objective of reducing Mobility Cars' stock.
